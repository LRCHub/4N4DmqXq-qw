[00:13.39] Fool me for a second time
[00:15.77] I guess the blame's all mine
[00:18.48] And acting cool was just a state of mind
[00:21.64] And so I say that I'm fine, but
[00:37.14] 
[00:24.68] And no, I never meant to feel this way, oh-woah
[00:30.52] And now I'm waiting for the light to change, and then I'm gone, yeah
[00:36.75] And maybe I can never make you stay, oh-woah
[00:42.87] And now I'm waiting for the light to change, and then I'm gone
[01:13.87] 
[00:49.31] You said that you're always right
[00:52.06] Put your foot on the gaslight
[00:55.05] If reality's a state of mind, you say what you want
[00:58.23] But I don't want to change mine
[01:13.73] 
[01:00.89] No, I never meant to feel this way, oh-woah
[01:06.75] And now I'm waiting for the light to change, and then I'm gone, yeah
[01:12.99] And maybe I can never make you stay, oh-woah
[01:18.83] And now I'm waiting for the light to change, and then I'm gone
[01:35.95] Name-drop
[01:37.29] Even though you won't admit it, you're a fame-bot
[01:39.76] Even though you can't commit, it doesn't change much
[01:43.14] You're pushing all the limits of the tame drugs
[02:06.64] 
[01:47.44] I won't give up
[01:49.09] Like I'm on an audition for the same love
[01:51.95] That everyone is missing, it don't take much (Oh-woah)
